The object detection script was changed, isntead of saving the images with the box and labels it saves the coordinates of the combination of detected objects.

If you do not have protobuffer in your environment you'll have to set it up.

You can download it here: https://github.com/google/protobuf/releases

Windows: protoc-3.5.1-win32.zip
Linux: protoc-3.5.1-linux-x86_64.zip or 32bits....

Extract it and add the bin folder to your PATH :)

Now you should be able to execute the command: 
(Do it in the hunter2_fashion folder)
protoc object_detection/protos/*.proto --python_out=.

After that, download http://download.tensorflow.org/models/object_detection/faster_rcnn_inception_resnet_v2_atrous_oid_2018_01_28.tar.gz

Put it in the hunter2_fashion folder and untar? it

Now you should be able to run python object_detection.py.

This script also take into account the broken images in the train dataset.

If you run this script for the first time, it will start processing image number 1.
If you interrupt this execution, when the script is ran again it will start in the image where it stopped.
